1. We all know equations on real number domain are studied a lot and
have ways to solve, and yes-or-no variables can also form equations.

2. Propositional logic argues with many single decisions, called variables.

3. In Boolean Satisfiabilty Problem (SAT), we find a set of values that
are either true or false to make the formula true.

4. SAT is a family of problems that are perverse in real world.

5. We use operators in logic formula to form CNF.

6. SAT is hard to solve.

7. We have rules and can syntactically reason with them.

8. We can semantically enumerate the possibilities of combinations and search for the
solution, which is hard.

9. Search can be guided to be efficient.

10. Typically, a DPLL or CDCL process is used for computers to solve
a SAT, which have the best of both worlds.
