## Part 1 - basic concepts:

    Time to start, <b>**bold**</b> truth-seekers! Today we are going to face a logical problem. Before that, have a look at this classic riddle:

    Three kids are accused of breaking a window. Their statements are either true or false. Only one is telling a lie.
    The first kid said, "he (the second kid) is telling a lie."
    The second kid said, "he (the third kid) broke the window."
    The third kid yelled, "I didn't!"

    Who's going to tell me, which one is telling a lie?
    </p>
</Teacher>

<Student name="A">
    <p>
        I might have seen this puzzle before. Let's assume all kids are telling truth,
        and what kid 1 said shows that kid 2 is telling a lie. A contradiction!

        Well, let's move on: if kid 1 is telling a lie, then kid 2 claims kid 3 broke the window while
        kid 3 denies, another contradiction!

        ...

<Student name="B">
    <p>
        Hey, move aside! I have found a secret. The statements of kid 1 and kid 2
        always contradicts, and at most one of them is true!

        The same is for kid 2 and kid 3. As a result, there is a lier between kid 1
        and kid 2, as well as between kid 2 and kid 3. As we know there is at most
        1 lier among the three, kid 2 is the lier!

<Student name="A">
    <p>I have just finish my enumeration, and I agree that's correct.</p>

        Good, you have found two different ways to solve the problem.
        However, we still need to look at it from a more formal perspective.

        Let's check your problem solving skills, which draw the same conclusion at last.
        However, they are intricately different. One checks all possible solutions,
        and filters out the unqualified.

        The other grows from solid assumptions, and everything it derives is qualified
        by nature. We call this *reasoning*.

        The reasoning process has some key elements, for example, axioms.
        Every reasoning process must have a beginning.
        
        And syntax, deduction, or rules, whatever you like. Like a detective, we draw a conclusion
        from the 'axioms'.

        And of course there is always a conclusion to be proved.
    </p>
</Teacher>

<Student>
    <p>
        Wow, this is where syntax comes in! So syntax is a way to rule out invalid
        things, by only a few characteristics on them!
    </p>
</Student>

<Teacher>
    <p>
        Exactly, and we usually call a statement *consistent*, if no contradiction
        can be reasoned from it. This is a way to rule out incorrect guesses.

        However, just like a detective solving a case, there are occasions when reasoning
        fails. When faced with similar puzzles, we human usually identify the reasoning rules,
        and try to deduce with them. If no more information can be deduced, we turn to the
        last method, enumerating possible solutions and seek *truths*.

        We consider this a semantic process, and the truths are said to be *satisfying*.
    </p>
</Teacher>

<Student>
    <p>
        So a semantic concept is always linked to the world or the basic facts.
    </p>
</Student>

The puzzle has three statements, each of which is either true or false.
Everything is a yes-or-no question, that is exactly how *proposition logic* sees the world.

We'll talk more about proposition logic later. In fact, our discussion is all about
proposition if not otherwise mentioned.

You can read more about abstract logic ideas, or move to the next chapter, on more humane reasoning.
