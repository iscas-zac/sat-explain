Time to start, <b>**bold**</b> truth-seekers! Today we are going to face a logical problem. Before that, have a look at this classic riddle:

Three kids are accused of breaking a window. Their statements are either true or false. Only one is telling a lie.
The first kid said, "he (the second kid) is telling a lie."
The second kid said, "he (the third kid) broke the window."
The third kid yelled, "I didn't!"

Who's going to tell me, which one is telling a lie?

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

I might have seen this puzzle before. Let's assume all kids are telling truth,
and what kid 1 said shows that kid 2 is telling a lie. A contradiction!

Well, let's move on: if kid 1 is telling a lie, then kid 2 claims kid 3 broke the window while
kid 3 denies, another contradiction!

</Student>

<Student name="B">

Hey, move aside! I have found a secret. The statements of kid 1 and kid 2
always contradicts, and at most one of them is true!

The same is for kid 2 and kid 3. As a result, there is a lier between kid 1
and kid 2, as well as between kid 2 and kid 3. As we know there is at most
1 lier among the three, kid 2 is the lier!

</Student>

<Student name="A">
I have just finish my enumeration, and I agree that's correct.
</Student>

<Teacher>

Good, you have found two different ways to solve the problem.
However, we still need to look at it from a more formal perspective.

Let's check your problem solving skills, which draw the same conclusion at last.
However, they are intricately different. One checks all possible solutions,
and filters out the unqualified.

The other grows from solid assumptions, and everything it derives is qualified
by nature. We call this *reasoning*.

The reasoning process has some key elements, for example, axioms.
Every reasoning process must have a beginning.

And syntax, deduction, or rules, whatever you like. Like a detective, we draw a conclusion
from the 'axioms'.

And of course there is always a conclusion to be proved.

</Teacher>

<Student name="you">

Wow, this is where syntax comes in! So syntax is a way to rule out invalid
things, by only a few characteristics on them!

</Student>

<Teacher>

Exactly, and we usually call a statement *consistent*, if no contradiction
can be reasoned from it. This is a way to rule out incorrect guesses.

However, just like a detective solving a case, there are occasions when reasoning
fails. When faced with similar puzzles, we human usually identify the reasoning rules,
and try to deduce with them. If no more information can be deduced, we turn to the
last method, enumerating possible solutions and seek *truths*.

We consider this a semantic process, and the truths are said to be *satisfying*.

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

So a semantic concept is always linked to the world or the basic facts.

</Student>

<Teacher>

The puzzle has three statements, each of which is either true or false.
Everything is a yes-or-no question, that is exactly how *propositional logic* sees the world.

We'll talk more about propositional logic later. In fact, our discussion is all about
propositions if not otherwise mentioned.

Before we move on, let's grab some syntactic and semantic concepts. We would say
in the reasoning process, some conclusion is **valid** given a set of conditions,
that is, by reasoning, we can reach the conclusion, just like math proof questions
in your middle school tests.

Now, who can give me a semantic version of validity?

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

Easy. By enumerating every statement's "trueness", a conclusion statement is always true
if the known conditions are all true!

Wait, does that mean, I can say "2 + 2 = 5" is valid and "semantically valid",
given the condition "1 + 1 = 3"? Nothing in the enumeration makes the
condition true, and they don't need to make the conclusion true then.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Yep, although your sentence is an arithmetic one and beyond our propositional logic.
It is sometimes stated as "anything can be derived from a contradiction".
By the way, the "semantical validity" is referred to as "derivability" here,
to avoid confusion with the "validity" of the statement.

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

I got it. Let me explain the syntactic and semantic consistency!

As stated before, the semantic consistency of a group of statements are
actually about finding a set of values in the world to make every statement
satisfy.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Yes. The semantic consistency is also called satisfiability,
and we are going to dig deep in that finding process later.

</Teacher>

<Student name="B">

And finally syntactic consistency! Like what satisfiability is to derivability,
it's also about finding a way to reason from some statement to some others!

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Anything can be derived from a contradiction,
and I remember that consistency means no contradiction can be deduced.

Can I make sure every statement derived is not a contradiction? That should suffice.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Sorry, there are usually infinite derivations from a propositional logic thing.
That is, a set of statements are inconsistent if contradiction can be deduced.
However, nothing tells you if they are consistent!

It's indeed a weird thing. You can easily tell something is not *consistent*,
but can never make sure it is *consistent*.

But try to recall the last time when you calculate the prime factors of a large number!
We easily see that 1561596 has a factor 2, but it may cost a lot to see if
1594897 is itself a prime number.

That asymmetry is partly studied in a field called "theory of computation",
and I believe we are still very superficial in this aspect.
