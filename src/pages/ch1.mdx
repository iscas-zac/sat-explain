Time to start, **bold** truth-seekers! Today we are going to solve some logical problems.
For example, have a look at this classic riddle:

Three kids are accused of breaking a window. Their statements are either true or false. Only one is telling a lie.

- 🐶 said, <span id="stmt1" data="     contradicts 😼!" onClick="
var stmt1 = document.getElementById('stmt1');
var stmt2 = document.getElementById('stmt2');
var stmt3 = document.getElementById('stmt3');
function click() {
  stmt1.classList.remove('red-borders');
  stmt2.classList.add('red-borders');
  stmt3.classList.add('red-borders');
};
click()">"😼 is telling a lie."</span>
- 😼 said, <span id="stmt2" data="contradicts!" onClick="
var stmt1 = document.getElementById('stmt1');
var stmt2 = document.getElementById('stmt2');
var stmt3 = document.getElementById('stmt3');
function click() {
  stmt1.classList.remove('red-borders');
  stmt2.classList.remove('red-borders');
  stmt3.classList.remove('red-borders');
};
click()">"🐰 broke the window."</span>
- 🐰 yelled, <span id="stmt3" data="     contradicts 😼!" onClick="
var stmt1 = document.getElementById('stmt1');
var stmt2 = document.getElementById('stmt2');
var stmt3 = document.getElementById('stmt3');
function click() {
  stmt1.classList.add('red-borders');
  stmt2.classList.add('red-borders');
  stmt3.classList.remove('red-borders');
};
click()">"I didn't!"</span>

<style>.red-borders \{ border: 1px solid red; \}
.red-borders[data]::after \{ content: attr(data); color: purple; font-size: small; \}</style>

Who's going to tell me, which one is telling a lie?
<i style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">(click
each sentence see the contradictions if it is a lie.)</i>

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

I might have seen this puzzle before. Let's assume if 🐰 is telling a lie,
and what 🐶 said shows that 😼 is telling a lie. A contradiction!

Well, let's move on: if 🐶 is telling a lie, then 😼 claims 🐰 broke the window while
🐰 denies, another contradiction! ...

<TodoModal>
make a table or something
</TodoModal>

</Student>

<Student name="B">

Hey, move aside! I have found a secret. The statements of 🐶 and 😼
always contradict with each other, so at most one of them is true!

The same is for 😼 and 🐰. As a result, there is a lier between 🐶
and 😼, as well as between 😼 and 🐰. As we know there is at most
1 lier among the three, 😼 is the lier!

</Student>

<Student name="A">

... If 😼 is telling a lie, then 🐶 is right, and 🐰 didn't broke the window.

I have just finish my enumeration, and I agree that's correct.

<span class="plain">
| 🐶 	| 😼 	| 🐰 	| result           	|
| :---:	| :---:	| :---:	| :----------: 	|
| ❌ 	| ✅ 	| ✅ 	| 🐰 contradicts 😼	|
| ✅ 	| ❌ 	| ✅ 	| ✅                	|
| ✅ 	| ✅ 	| ❌ 	| 🐶 contradicts 😼	|
</span>
<span class="formal">

Of course, I've also noticed that not all possibilities are listed here!
The words "only 1️⃣ is telling a lie" explicitly excluded some possibilities.


| 🐶 	| 😼 	| 🐰 	| result           	|
| :---:	| :---:	| :---:	| :----------: 	|
| ❌ 	| ✅ 	| ✅ 	| 🐰 contradicts 😼	|
| ✅ 	| ❌ 	| ✅ 	| ✅                	|
| ✅ 	| ✅ 	| ❌ 	| 🐶 contradicts 😼	|
| ❌ 	| ❌ 	| ✅ 	| contradicts 1️⃣, and (🐶 lies) contradicts (😼 lies)	|
| ✅ 	| ❌ 	| ❌ 	| contradicts 1️⃣, and (🐰 lies) contradicts (😼 lies)	|
| ❌ 	| ✅ 	| ❌ 	| contradicts 1️⃣	|
| ❌ 	| ❌ 	| ❌ 	| contradicts 1️⃣🐰 contradicts 😼	|
| ✅ 	| ✅ 	| ✅ 	| contradicts 1️⃣, 🐰 and 🐶 contradict 😼 |

<Teacher>

Good, you have found two different ways to solve the problem.
However, we still need to look at them from a more formal perspective.

As you have discovered, we are now dealing with the *statement*s, or
sentences / propositions / formulas, which are interchangeably used here.

<span class="formal">
> A statement can be defined as a declarative sentence, or part of a sentence,
that is capable of having a truth-value, such as being true or false. (Quote
from [online resource](https://iep.utm.edu/propositional-logic-sentential-logic/))
</span>

for you who easily spot the contradiction, and derive everything from the prerequisites,
we call this process *(formal) reasoning*.

<TodoModal>
highlight with color, emoji and even styles
</TodoModal>

The reasoning process is like inspecting a crime case, which involves classical steps.
We have premises, some statements given as a starting point; we have syntax rules,
with which a new statement is acquired from existing ones; and we have a
target, or conclusion, the fact we desire.

In this syntax, we say something is **derivable**, or provable, given a set of conditions,
that is, by reasoning, we can reach the conclusion, just like math proof questions
in your middle school tests.

<span class="formal">

The related theory is proof theory.

</span>

</Teacher>

<Student name="B">

This is where syntax comes in? So syntax is a way to rule out
things by only focusing on the valid statements.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Exactly, and we usually call a statement *consistent*, if no contradiction
can be reasoned from it. This is a way to rule out incorrect guesses.<span class="formal">
Contradiction in propositional logic is simply claiming some statement is both
true and false.</span>

However, just like a detective solving a case, there are occasions when reasoning
fails. When faced with similar puzzles, we humans usually identify the reasoning rules,
and try to deduce with them. If no more information can be deduced, we turn to the
other method, enumerating possible solutions and seek *truths*.

For you who check all possible solutions, and filter out the unqualified,
the work is tedious, yet effective. When we talk about *enumerate*,
*possibility*, *combination*, we are using this method.

We consider this a semantic process, and the truths are said to be *satisfying*,
or simply *true*, in our daily sense. Note the key difference between a
true sentence and a provable sentence, although they usually comes together.

<span class="formal">

The related theory is model theory. So the thing is a bit tricker when involving a 
model of the world. For some logic, the thing that is directly linked to
a logical object is not unique, and may involve multiple *interpretation*s.

</span>

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

So a semantic concept is always linked to the world or the basic facts.

</Student>

<Teacher>

The puzzle has three statements, each of which is either true or false.
Everything is a yes-or-no question, that is exactly how *propositional logic* sees the world.

We'll talk more about propositional logic later. In fact, our discussion is all about
propositions if not otherwise mentioned.

Before we move on, let's grab some syntactic and semantic concepts. We have
see the syntactic concept derivability before.
Now, who can give me a semantic version of derivability?

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

Easy. By enumerating every truth value combination like every line in
the table I drew, a conclusion statement is always true
if the known conditions are all true!

Wait, does that mean, I can say "2 + 2 = 5" is derivable and "semantically derivable",
given the condition "1 + 1 = 3"? Nothing makes the
condition true, and they don't need to make the conclusion true then.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Yep, despite that your sentence is an arithmetic statement and beyond our propositional logic.
We'd better only consider the formulas whose truth value can be enumerated!
It is sometimes stated as "anything can be derived from a contradiction".

By the way, *semantical derivability* is referred to as *validity* here,
to avoid confusion with the "validity" of the statement.

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

I get it. And we have seen the semantical consistency!

As stated before, the semantical consistency of a group of statements are
actually about finding a set of values in the world to make every statement
satisfy.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Yes. The semantical consistency is also called satisfiability,
<TodoModal>
explain what SAT means
</TodoModal>
and we are going to talk about how to know if a statement is satisfiable.
In propositional logic, it is called *Boolean Satisfiability Problem*, or
SAT for short. For example, we decided which one is lying in the puzzle.

</Teacher>

<Student name="B">

And finally, syntactic consistency! Like what satisfiability is to derivability,
it's also about finding a way to reason from some statement to some others!

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Anything can be derived from a contradiction,
and I remember that consistency means no contradiction can be deduced.

Can I make sure every statement derived is not a contradiction? That should suffice.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Sorry, there are usually infinite derivations from a propositional logic thing.
That is, a set of statements are inconsistent if contradiction can be deduced.
However, nothing tells you if they are consistent!

It's indeed a weird thing. You can easily tell something is not *consistent*,
but can never make sure it is *consistent*.

But try to recall the last time when you factorize a large number!
We easily see that 1561596 has a factor 2, but it may cost a lot to see if
1594897 is itself a prime number.

That asymmetry is partly studied in a field called *theory of computation*,
and I believe we are still very superficial in that aspect.

<TodoModal>
give more exercises

Exercise:

1. tell me if pythagoras theorem is derivable or valid, in the case when
someone deduces it from some geometrical magic.

<Summary

<TodoModal>
there is better a link to the place where it first appears
</TodoModal>

- We talked about semantic (satisfiability, derivability) and syntactic (consistency, validity) concepts.
- The propositional logic only cares about some statements' truth value.
