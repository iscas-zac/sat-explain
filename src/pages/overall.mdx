# From riddles to DPLL(T): An Adventure

## Part 0 - guide:

In history of problem solving, logic is one of the keys to a 'universal theory'.

In this article, I'd like to explain in detail about logic in a computer era, especially
about the SAT problem and the DPLL, CDCL and DPLL(T) algorithms.

But first, let me ask you readers a few questions. Please choose best answers and
follow the path.
