# From riddles to DPLL(T): An Adventure

## Part 0 - guide:

In history of problem solving, logic is one of the keys to a 'universal theory'.

In this article, I'd like to explain in detail about logic in a computer era, especially
about the SAT problem and the DPLL, CDCL and DPLL(T) algorithms.

But first, let me ask you readers a few questions. Please choose best answers and
follow the path.

P0 - Question 1:

What is the difference between syntactic and semantic concepts in logic?

A. A syntactic concept means something one wants to convey by a statement, while a semantic
one means something it actually conveys.
B. A syntactic concept means something to be deduced, while a semantic one
means something to be verified.
C. A syntactic concept means something true by default, while a semantic one
means something to be proved.
D. I want to learn more about it.

(this decides whether the reader should skip part 1.)

P0 - Question 2:

Which is not one of the fundamental laws of logic:

A. the law of excluded middle
B. the law of contradiction
C. the law of induction
D. I want to learn more about it.

P0 - Question 3:

What is the full name of CNF in the context of proposition logic?

A. cell normal form
B. conjunctive normal form
C. Cackus-Naur form
D. I want to learn more about it.

P0 - Question 4:

Would you like to read with supplementary materials or a one-page version?

A. longer version
B. TL; DR

## Part 1 - basic concepts:

<Teacher>

    Time to start, <b>**bold**</b> truth-seekers! Today we are going to face a logical problem. Before that, have a look at this classic riddle:

    Three kids are accused of breaking a window. Their statements are either true or false. Only one is telling a lie.
    The first kid said, "he (the second kid) is telling a lie."
    The second kid said, "he (the third kid) broke the window."
    The third kid yelled, "I didn't!"

    Who's going to tell me, which one is telling a lie?
    </p>
</Teacher>

<Student name="A">
    <p>
        I might have seen this puzzle before. Let's assume all kids are telling truth,
        and what kid 1 said shows that kid 2 is telling a lie. A contradiction!

        Well, let's move on: if kid 1 is telling a lie, then kid 2 claims kid 3 broke the window while
        kid 3 denies, another contradiction!

        ...
    </p>
</Student>

<Student name="B">
    <p>
        Hey, move aside! I have found a secret. The statements of kid 1 and kid 2
        always contradicts, and at most one of them is true!

        The same is for kid 2 and kid 3. As a result, there is a lier between kid 1
        and kid 2, as well as between kid 2 and kid 3. As we know there is at most
        1 lier among the three, kid 2 is the lier!
    </p>
</Student>

<Student name="A">
    <p>I have just finish my enumeration, and I agree that's correct.</p>
</Student>

<Teacher>
    <p>
        Good, you have found two different ways to solve the problem.
        However, we still need to look at it from a more formal perspective.

        Let's check your problem solving skills, which draw the same conclusion at last.
        However, they are intricately different. One checks all possible solutions,
        and filters out the unqualified.

        The other grows from solid assumptions, and everything it derives is qualified
        by nature. We call this *reasoning*.

        The reasoning process has some key elements, for example, axioms.
        Every reasoning process must have a beginning.
        
        And syntax, deduction, or rules, whatever you like. Like a detective, we draw a conclusion
        from the 'axioms'.

        And of course there is always a conclusion to be proved.
    </p>
</Teacher>

<Student>
    <p>
        Wow, this is where syntax comes in! So syntax is a way to rule out invalid
        things, by only a few characteristics on them!
    </p>
</Student>

<Teacher>
    <p>
        Exactly, and we usually call a statement *consistent*, if no contradiction
        can be reasoned from it. This is a way to rule out incorrect guesses.

        However, just like a detective solving a case, there are occasions when reasoning
        fails. When faced with similar puzzles, we human usually identify the reasoning rules,
        and try to deduce with them. If no more information can be deduced, we turn to the
        last method, enumerating possible solutions and seek *truths*.

        We consider this a semantic process, and the truths are said to be *satisfying*.
    </p>
</Teacher>

<Student>
    <p>
        So a semantic concept is always linked to the world or the basic facts.
    </p>
</Student>

The puzzle has three statements, each of which is either true or false.
Everything is a yes-or-no question, that is exactly how *proposition logic* sees the world.

We'll talk about proposition logic more later. In fact, our discussion is all about
proposition if not otherwise mentioned.

You can read more about abstract logic ideas, or move to the next chapter, on more humane reasoning.

## Part 4 - DPLL, CDCL and DPLL(T):

 I wrote more than three hundred computer programs while preparing this
material, because I find that I don't understand things unless I try to program
them. - Don Knuth, in *The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4 Fascicle 6, Satisfiability*

(the DPLL(T) explained for the impatient)

Many classic puzzles, as well as real-life problems, can be abstracted
as a <b>SAT problem</b>, 


## Part 5 - afterwords:

I wrote this in my own way to learn about this SAT problem, and therefore
there may be mistakes in the article.

There are many good publications on this topic. I consult a few pages in
<a href="https://www.iospress.nl/book/handbook-of-satisfiability-2/">Handbook of Satisfiability</a>
and <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Knuth-Art-of-Computer-Programming-Volume-4-Fascicle-6-The-Satisfiability/PGM328228.html">
The Art of Computer programming, Volume 4 Fascicle 6</a>, for the theory
part, and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/">Z3 Guide</a> for
the use of Z3.
