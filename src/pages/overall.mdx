# From riddles to DPLL(T): An Adventure

## Part 0 - guide:

In history of problem solving, logic is one of the keys to a 'universal theory'.

In this article, I'd like to explain in detail about logic in a computer era, especially
about the SAT problem and the DPLL, CDCL and DPLL(T) algorithms.

But first, let me ask you readers a few questions. Please choose best answers and
follow the path.

P0 - Question 1:

What is the difference between syntactic and semantic concepts in logic?

A. A syntactic concept means something one wants to convey by a statement, while a semantic
one means something it actually conveys.
B. A syntactic concept means something to be deduced, while a semantic one
means something to be verified.
C. A syntactic concept means something true by default, while a semantic one
means something to be proved.
D. I want to learn more about it.

(this decides whether the reader should skip part 1.)

P0 - Question 2:

Which is not one of the fundamental laws of logic:

A. the law of excluded middle
B. the law of contradiction
C. the law of induction
D. I want to learn more about it.

P0 - Question 3:

What is the full name of CNF in the context of proposition logic?

A. cell normal form
B. conjunctive normal form
C. Cackus-Naur form
D. I want to learn more about it.

P0 - Question 4:

Would you like to read with supplementary materials or a one-page version?

A. longer version
B. TL; DR
