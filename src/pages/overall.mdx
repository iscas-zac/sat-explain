In history of problem solving, logic is one of the keys to a 'universal theory'.

You have always been interested in logic, but those symbols were too annoying.

One day, you stumbled across a big book, with a title "Logic: the Gathering".
You picked it up, and found some sentences on the preface. 

"
Dear reader, I have always struggled to learn logic and the solving methods.
Why is the problem special? What are the difference between the solutions?
It's only when thoughts collide with each other that the underlying
structure becomes clear.

</Highlighter> times faster.
"

You decided to read it, but the book seemed so old, that you were afraid

## tips
1. Any feedback is welcome at https://github.com/iscas-zac/sat-explain/discussions.
2. Here used to be some AI illustrations. According to 
[SoME's AI policy](https://some.3b1b.co/content-policy#ai), I replaced them with
my poor hand-drawn. Well, I am thinking of updating them.
3. Use <Highlighter target="mode" description="oops, you found me?">
<span class="bare">different browsing modes</span> </Highlighter>
on the upper right selection bar.
4. Have fun!
