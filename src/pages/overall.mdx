Imaging the joy when lifting your head from a pile of calculating paper,
and the thrill beneath these math equations when some number
magically appears out of the dark side.

And imaging you have always been interested in logic, wondering if there is some logical counterpart
as opposed to math equations. But its symbols were too annoying.

One day, you stumbled across a big book, with a title "Logic: the Gathering".
You picked it up, and found some sentences on the preface. 

<style>blockquote \{ max-width: 80%; \}</style>

> Dear reader, I have always struggled to learn logic and the problem solving techniques.

> How to solve a problem? How to do it quickly? What are the difference between techniques?
These occured to me in a maze, which hopefully I can share with you.

> It's only when thoughts collide with each other that the underlying
structure will become clear.
Let us learn <Highlighter target="version" title="Version"

This version is updated on 26th, code playground partially supported.

<span id="version" style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">1.0.4</span>
</Highlighter> times faster!

You decided to read it, but the book seemed so old, that you were afraid
it would break into pieces.

Some front pages seemed in a good condition, but the words in pages near
the back were just a mess. So maybe only the first part was worth reading?
<div style="font-size: 0.8em;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.2;">
(sorry, the article is still in progress. Part 1 is almost done, but take
some risk if you would read more. Aug. 26th.)

make this sound more natural?

Well, you were putting your finger on that weird-looking book,
thinking that it would bring you some knowledge on logical problem
solving.

Something fell from between the pages.

<TodoModal>
beautify the select thing, better add a video option

## tips
1. Any feedback is welcome at https://github.com/iscas-zac/sat-explain/discussions.
Things are still changing here and will possibly adapt to your suggestions.
2. Here used to be some AI illustrations. According to 
[SoME's AI policy](https://some.3b1b.co/content-policy#ai), I replaced them with
my poor hand-drawn. Well, I am thinking of updating them.
3. Use <Highlighter target="mode" description="oops, you found me?
Well, The MODEs are intended to introduce in a different flavor, for example
the VOICE mode should involve some listening instead of reading.
Unfortunately they are mostly not working for now.">
<span class="bare">different browsing modes</span> </Highlighter>
on the upper right selection bar.
4. The appendices and most of the Modes are
unfinished in version 1.0.3, as well as some conversation paragraphs.
5. Have fun!
