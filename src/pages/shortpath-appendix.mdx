It seems that today's network dwellers are capable of discovering
a whole new world with a single keyword, and here are a few keywords
and concepts for you if you want to find out more by yourself.

**SAT** and **SMT** are two problem families that can model most
problems in real world, who lay in the heart of our discussion.

The complexity class **NP-Complete** shows how and why a problem is *hard*.
It has many peers, like **P**, **PSPACE**, **BQP**, and so on.

**GÃ¶del** discovered the deep-rooted flaw of our logical system, defining
a boundary where our computation can reach, while the complexity defines
how hard to reach it.

**DPLL** and **CDCL** are two stages of the same mainstream **SAT solver** algorithm,
and **DPLL(T)** is a SMT solver algorithm as a extension of CDCL.

**Z3**, **CVC5** and their peers are the cutting edge SAT/SMT solvers.
