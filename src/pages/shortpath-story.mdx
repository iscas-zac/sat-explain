Once upon a time, three brave young men were summoned by the king,
who announced a task. "A cruel monster, Minotaur, is living inside a maze.
He has a lot of treasures with him. Go get him and you are the hero."

But first, they got to think about the puzzle on the treasure map. It was
the only way to know where the maze was.

The mysterious signs on the puzzle looked like four switches with a name
on their each branch. However, the first, the third and the fourth are
twisted to make their downside branches cross out each other. The second,
the

The first young man, an accountant, decided to find all combinations of
the switches. He ordered his men to draw copies of the treasure map,
cross out different branches, and see if the final branches consists of
some information of their destination.

He made it after a whole day, with loss of three hundred pieces of paper and
some men because of headache. They sailed out for the maze, only to find
the maze had an even hard puzzle on its walls. They soon forgot which
combination they had tried and wasted much time. The accountant wanted no
risk, and they returned empty-handed.

The second, a detective, was confident that he could easily
spot the interconnection inside the puzzle. He by himself ruled out
some tricky edge cases, and happily found out that only one way leads
to the final conclusion.

It was only an hour when he finished. He went on the journey on foot,
and arrived just one day after the accountant. He was also faced with
the puzzles on the wall. They had many options and actually contained
some hidden paths to get to the monster.

The detective found that the clue did not lead to a single end. He was
also unable to memorize so long a path. He went into the maze recklessly,
hoping to run over a good path. No one knew what happened to him ever
after.

The third, a teacher, told his students to try various ways to solve
the puzzle. They took out some parts of the puzzle once a time, and
carefully place the switch to make everything connected, and put things
back. If some parts were then ill-configured, they took out previous
parts to try another position.

After trail and error, they got out with the correct answer and hand-made
some machanical vehicle for transportation. Once they saw the walls,
the teacher assigned different parts to his students, and made schedules
to separate the puzzle properly.

They finally figured out a solution and aborted the remaining calculation.
Of course, the path was correct, and they found the bull-head creature.

He stared at them, his hair whirled in the wind, and his voice thundered at
their ears, "Another troops of adventurer! What do you want this time,
according to that silly old man with the crown?"

"Don't just let the past dominate you. You are probably another typical
hero that only lives between the pages!

"Now you've learned that something is buried according to the treasure map.
You've learned the world is so complex that reasoning is of little
use. You've learned enumerating is so exhausting. You've learned we still
have some way to squeeze the power out of pen and paper and any such
computing devices, by combining them together. You've learned to look at
the world from your own eyes and choose what you really need.

"Tell me again, what do you come for."

The story after that became a tale then. Some said that the brave hero
kissed the monster and turned it into a human, and some said they just
kissed but no one changed and they lived happily ever after. (Hey, who
care about that?) Some said the knowledge was later summarized into a
subject called "constraint solving". Some said one of them in the story
later wrote a page about that.

What about you, dear reader? Would you read more about it?
