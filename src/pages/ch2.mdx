<Teacher>

In the last chapter, we have a discussion on some abstract logic concepts, especially
the difference between (syntactic) proof with rules and (semantic)
check with evaluation.

But we can not go far without even knowing what propositional logic is.
Propositional logic is a logic branch, which focuses on reasoning with
atom statements and their simple combinations.

For example, '<font color="red">it is raining outside</font> <font color="yellow">and</font>
<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font>' can be
abstracted to be a *single statement*, and it will be either right or wrong.
But it does not give much information to look at a single statement.

Luckily, propositional logic allows us to see it in a slightly different
way. I will say '<font color="red">it is raining outside</font>' is a single statement, and
'<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font>' is another one. They are connected with a conjungation,
'<font color="yellow">and</font>', to form a *compound statement*.

Now, if I say the compound statement is true, are the two single ones true
or false? What if they are connected by '<font color="yellow">or</font>'?

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

If '<font color="red">it is raining outside</font> <font color="yellow">and</font>
<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font>' are (both) true,
then '<font color="red">it is raining outside</font>' is true and
'<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font>' is true.

Hey, I'm also use 'and's here. But they are different,
the second part of my sentence is not a compound statement, but an answer to your
question!

</Student>

<Student name="B">

As to 'or' case, it seems one of the statements should be true, but I
don't know which one.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Good! In logic, we usually need to separate a statement *in the logic
system*, and one *out of the system and in we humans' mind*.

In the system, we have a set of statements, or *literal*s or *variable*s,
like '<font color="red">it is raining outside</font>'
and '<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font>'; we have some conjungations,
or *operator*s, like '<font color="yellow">and</font>', '<font color="yellow">or</font>,'
and '<font color="yellow">not</font>'; and we have deducing rules, compound statements, etc.

However, note that the operators do not all connect two things together.
A <font color="yellow">not</font> only affect one statement. In general,
an operator is a mixer, you add any number of items, and get one thing out.

As to the logical <font color="yellow">or</font>, people agree that it produces
'true' if one or two statements are true. In the case above, we only know
<font color="red">it is raining outside</font> and
<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font> are not both false.

Semantically, an operator is with an enumeration of values of its ingredients.
Who can tell me how many possibilities are values for <font color="yellow">or</font>?

</Teacher>

<Student name="A">

There are four in total.
- 'Something true' <font color="yellow">or</font> 'something false', produces true.
- 'Something false' <font color="yellow">or</font> 'something false', produces false.
- 'Something true' <font color="yellow">or</font> 'something true', produces true.
- 'Something false' <font color="yellow">or</font> 'something true', produces true.

</Student>

<Teacher>

It is effective. We can now even get a good representation of the puzzle in chapter 1!

However, as humans, we mostly want to derive conclusions of interest with simple rules.
What are the most elegant rules in your experience?

</Teacher>

<Student name="B">

Definitely $$ E = m c^{2} $$.

</Student>


<Student name="you">

Mmm, I like <TextArea />.

<Student name="A">

Hey hey, I would say the three logical laws, as this is a logic class:

1. the law of identity;
2. the law of (non-)contradiction;
3. the law of excluded middle.

They are the foundation of logic!

</Student>

<Teacher>

'You stole my answer!'

Am I going to say that? If you think I would spend the whole class introducing these
laws, then you are wrong. They are by no means equivalence to Newton's
laws in physics anyway.

For those who have not heard 'the laws of thought', I'm giving a brief
yet rough introduction.

- The law of identity states that, you should stick to something where you
admitted it.

- The law of (non-)contradiction says, some statement can not be both true
or false in the same place.

- The law of excluded middle tells us that a statement should be nothing
else than true or false.

However, these laws are mostly related to simple propositional logic,
while modern logicians focus more on other things. Even inside propositional
logic itself, there are more useful rules to reason with.

For example, some of you might see that there is a redundency to provide 3 operators in
our system. A rule widely known as "De Morgan rule" states that, given two
arbitrary statement A and B,

- A <span style="font: bold;">OR</span> B \
is equivalent to \
NOT ((NOT A) <font color="yellow">AND</font> (NOT B)).

<TodoModal>
put that stuff to "formal" mode and leave a metaphor here
</TodoModal>

Thus, any occurrence of OR could be replaced by AND and NOT.

</Teacher>

<Student>

How long the rule is! But it indeed looks like the distributive law in
elementary arithmetic.

</Student>

<Teacher>

Then the following should come a little harder, belt up!

We are introducing an important rule called "resolution":
$$
(A\quad\mathbb{OR}\quad B)\quad\mathbb{AND}\quad((\mathbb{NOT}\quad A)
\quad \mathbb{OR}\quad C)
$$

is equivalent to

$$
(B\quad\mathbb{OR}\quad C)
$$
. If B and C are compound, they should not contain any same single variables.

Or if it seems too overwhelming, there is a plain-text example of it,
given

- if <font color="red">it is raining outside</font> then
<font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font>

- if not <font color="red">it is raining outside</font> then
<font color="green">I am wearing a coat</font>

, we will have

- either <font color="blue">I am taking an umbrella</font> or
<font color="green">I am wearing a coat</font>

. Note that this if-statement is one of the explanations of the formula.
Please check that after class.

Using the resolution rule, let's actually derive something from the
puzzle we see before.

Let's introduce propositional variables A, B and C, each representing
the sentences of kid 1, 2 and 3 is a truth, and a variable D to indicate
"kid 3 broke the window".

</Teacher>

<Student name="AABB">

I will do the labor. If B is true, then kid 3 broke the window and D is
true. We say "not B or D" then.

If C is true, then kid 3 didn't break the window and D is false. We say
"not C or not D" then.

</Student>

<Student name="BBZZ">

Since we need to satisfy both the two compound statements, we say "
'not B or D' and 'not C or not D'", or
$$
(D\quad\mathbb{OR}\quad (\mathbb{NOT}\quad B))\quad\mathbb{AND}\quad((\mathbb{NOT}\quad D)
\quad \mathbb{OR}\quad (\mathbb{NOT}\quad C))
$$
that is,
'((not B) or (not C))'.

With a similar reasoning process, we have '((not B) or (not A))'.

Because only one of them three is lying, if not B, then A and C.

...

</Student>

<Teacher>

In this practice, we see how hard reasoning is, and simply think when
there are thousands of variables in a more practical scene! Next chapter,
we are looking at a more mechanical approach. You can also halt and refer
to our appendix on various logical systems.

Exercise:

1. the 'and' operator can be replaced with 'or' and 'not', and can 'or' be
replaced by 'and' and 'not'? What about 'not' by 'and' and 'or'? Is there
an operator that can alone represent them all?

2. explain De Morgan law to your friends in a plain manner.
