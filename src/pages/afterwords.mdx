I wrote this in my own way to learn about this SAT problem, and therefore
there may be mistakes in the article.

There are many good publications on this topic. I consult a few pages in
<a href="https://www.iospress.nl/book/handbook-of-satisfiability-2/">Handbook of Satisfiability</a>
and <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Knuth-Art-of-Computer-Programming-Volume-4-Fascicle-6-The-Satisfiability/PGM328228.html">
The Art of Computer programming, Volume 4 Fascicle 6</a>, for the theory
part, and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/">Z3 Guide</a> for
the use of Z3.

For CDCL programming, consult <a href="https://cse442-17f.github.io/Conflict-Driven-Clause-Learning/">this link</a>.

For a better visual of how hard SAT is, consult <a href="https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~roussel/satgame/satgame.php">The SAT Game</a>.

This article is written for [3Blue1Brown's SoME3](https://some.3b1b.co/). It is inspired
by [a nice-looking article on CPU](https://cpu.land/), [Ciechanowski's visual guides](https://ciechanow.ski)
and 3Blue1Brown's videos.

In the writing, I also referred to some AI generated materials, especially those
from [Claude](https://claude.ai) and mirror links of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
and [MidJourney](https://midjourney.com). Their existence can be found among
various css style blocks in my project, and a concept art folder that are removed
due to SoME's policy.

The font of conversations is [im-fell-dw-pica](https://fontsource.org/fonts/im-fell-dw-pica), and the font of editable
notes is [indie-flower](https://fontsource.org/fonts/indie-flower). I'm also not very familiar
with how to use copyrighted fonts, so tell me if that is improper.

As I am a noob both in front-end developing and in English, there may be
flaws among the pages. Report them in the [github repo](https://github.com/iscas-zac/sat-explain),
either by discussions or by issues. (Why isn't there a comment bar? Because
this is a static site and I don't expect much feedback.)

<TodoModal>
fix the link below, now only rely on the HTML-style link

Of course, you can always go back to <a href={ `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}overall` }>read again</a>.
