## Part 5 - afterwords:

I wrote this in my own way to learn about this SAT problem, and therefore
there may be mistakes in the article.

There are many good publications on this topic. I consult a few pages in
<a href="https://www.iospress.nl/book/handbook-of-satisfiability-2/">Handbook of Satisfiability</a>
and <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Knuth-Art-of-Computer-Programming-Volume-4-Fascicle-6-The-Satisfiability/PGM328228.html">
The Art of Computer programming, Volume 4 Fascicle 6</a>, for the theory
part, and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/">Z3 Guide</a> for
the use of Z3.

For CDCL programming, consult <a href="https://cse442-17f.github.io/Conflict-Driven-Clause-Learning/">this link</a>.
