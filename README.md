# A tour of SAT

This is the source of my article for [SoME3](https://some.3b1b.co/).

## made with astro

The article is built on [astrojs](https://astro.build/), with some
elements randomly shipped from [driverjs](https://driverjs.com/),
[quined HTML](https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html),
[monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) and
many other things.

.. and I spent a whole day to configure the github actions,
only to find that I misspelled the name of PAT token.
